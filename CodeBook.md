Section 2: Data
Data was supplied via the getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip dataset available at:
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  
Included files:
  'README.txt' - Background information on the experiment and dataset
  'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
  'features.txt': List of all features.
  'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
  'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
  'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
  'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
  'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Section 3: Transformations
Key transformations for this project revolved around merging data from different files into a single dataset.
Measurements in the x_train and x_test files were merged with subject numbers in the subject_train and subject_test sets to assign measurements to given experiment participants and to the y_train and y_test set to assign activity numbers. These mergers created df_test and df_train dataframes, respectively, with the features.txt file supplying descriptive variable names for both tables.
The activity numbers were transformed to descriptive names by using the activity_labels.txt file as a lookup.

After creating df_train and df_test dataframes, these were merged to form a single, descriptve data set (df_all).

From df_all, a new dataframe was created that included only measurements of means or standard deviations, df_select.
From df_select, df_avgs was created containing means for each unique subject/activity pairing for all measurements. This dataframe (df_avgs) is then written to the tidy_averages.txt file stored in the current working directory.
